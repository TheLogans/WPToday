##A USAToday inspired Theme Framework for WordPress

The only plugin dependency that we have is [Advanced Custom Fields](http://www.advancedcustomfields.com "Advanced Custom Fields"). Just download and install the base version.

Once you have installed and activated the frameowrk and the plugin, simply add the following custom field to the post type:

* Story Highlights &mdash; story_highlights &mdash; Text Area

Create your categories and you're off. Pretty simple.
